# Image Processing Repository

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the basics of image processing and various techniques used in the field. The notebooks cover a range of topics, including functions, contour analysis, color detection, correlation theorem, feature extraction, Fourier transformation, and segmentation.

## Table of Contents

1. [Introduction to Image Processing](notebooks/01_Introduction.ipynb): Provides an overview of image processing concepts, including image representation, pixel manipulation, and image transformation techniques.

2. [Functions in Image Processing](notebooks/02_Functions.ipynb): Explores various functions used in image processing, such as image filtering, thresholding, and morphological operations.

3. [Contour Analysis](notebooks/03_Contour_Analysis.ipynb): Demonstrates contour detection and analysis techniques, including contour approximation, bounding boxes, and convex hulls.

4. [Color Detection](notebooks/04_Color_Detection.ipynb): Shows how to detect and extract specific colors from images using color spaces and thresholding techniques.

5. [Correlation Theorem](notebooks/05_Correlation_Theorem.ipynb): Discusses the correlation theorem and its applications in image processing, including image filtering and template matching.

6. [Feature Extraction](notebooks/06_Feature_Extraction.ipynb): Covers feature extraction methods like Harris Corner Detection and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for identifying and describing distinctive image features.

7. [Fourier Transformation](notebooks/07_Fourier_Transformation.ipynb): Explores the Fourier transformation and its applications in image analysis, including frequency domain filtering and image reconstruction.

8. [Image Segmentation](notebooks/08_Image_Segmentation.ipynb): Focuses on image segmentation techniques, including thresholding, edge detection, and region-based segmentation algorithms.
